# lbgfx
Lobster Graphics Framework.

lbgfx is a minimal-dependency 2D/3D graphics framework built to be extremely modular and extendable.
Currently built for Windows using DirectX 11, future frameworks and OS support planned.

lbgfx uses a unique approach to Graphics Framework development as it encapsulates major classes inside singleton instances for the developer to use.
This allows for a very modular and functional programming environment.

## In Development:
- Font rendering (see [SotfP](https://github.com/NicholasTranquilli/SotfP) project)
- OBJ Model File and Texture loading.

## Coming soon:
- Dynamic lighting
- Modular IO base management system
- Modular basic physics engine
