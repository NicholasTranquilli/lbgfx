# lbgfx
Lobster Graphics Framework.

lbgfx is a minimal-dependency 2D/3D graphics framework built to be extremely modular and extendable.
Currently built for Windows using DirectX 11, future frameworks and OS support planned.

lbgfx uses a unique approach to Graphics Framework development as it encapsulates major classes inside singleton instances for the developer to use.
This allows for a very modular and functional programming environment.
